1. All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. I believe I adhered to every guidline stated in the assignment spec sheet. One thing I noticed was that although each viewports were precisly calculated, the frames did not look identical which I assume means the original png file did not have precise, symmetrical margins.

2. Supriya Sanjay helped me strategize (The same method Ming suggested; making the first picture show first).

3. 4-5 hours were spent on this assignment.
