Assignment: Lab 10, Closest MBTA Subway Station, Part 2
Name: Kam Chan Kang (Chan)
GitHub: kamchankang

1. All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented for part 2. However, although I do not have any errors, I have a couple of warnings (which Ming said points won't be taken off for) and other inconsistent glitches (e.g., spherical not always being defined; refreshing the page seems to work) that I would have liked to taken care of if I had managed my time better for this week. I did not get to try "going beyond" parts, but I plan to revist this assignement later and attempt all of them.

2. N/A; MBTA and Google Developers references were definitely helpful.

3. 4.0 hours
