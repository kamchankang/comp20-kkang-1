Assignment: Lab 8, Closest MBTA Subway Station, Part 1
Name: Kam Chan Kang (Chan)

1. All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented for part 1. I plan to use more loops and arrays/lists so that there is less "hard-coding". I wrote some code for the marker's displaying informatin on the station when clicked on, but because I do not have the full implementation for it to work (No 'title' in my markers), I commented that section out.

2. Roy Kim helped me locate the resources/references for different aspects of the assignment.

3. 3.5 hours
