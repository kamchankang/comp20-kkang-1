1. All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented for part 3. 

2. Ming Chow; Although my code for lab 10 worked, it was disorganized and unnecessarily long. Therefore, I made a revision, modeled after Ming's solution for lab 10, before proceeding to work on lab 12. *There are some typos in Ming's code that makes 'Park Street' hidden and it doesn't have the red poly lines, so it was not just copy & paste.
   Roy Kim; Roy referred me to the reference he used for CORS.
